# HOW TO USE THIS!

I think this is pretty simple to use, but I will explain here anyways. Two of the tools **don't** have a personalized save-to-png feature. But anyways... 

**WordWall**, firstly, you can either refresh the page using the browser refresh, using F5, or using the website refresh link found in the *description*.

**Gradient Designer** this has multiple features. One feature is a preset function; you can pick preloaded graphic design gradients created by me; you can also *save* and *delete* presets, as well as export and import preset gradients you have. The export-import function works, it just **looks scary** to an outsider! 

**Next** feature is our gradient viewer, where you can (obviously) **view** your creation! Below all of this is **Gradient Properties**; you can neither choose simple or advanced features, and advanced has **one extra** feature - a direction tool. Both have color choices to choose from, direction of your gradient colors, and more. *You can also categorize your Gradients by linear/radial, and if it's a repeating gradient or not.
